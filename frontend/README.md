# 3D Earth Asteroid Impact Simulator

A realistic 3D Earth model with real NASA asteroid data, trajectory calculations, and impact consequence modeling. Built with Next.js, React Three Fiber, and TypeScript.

## Features

- üåç **Realistic 3D Earth** with high-quality textures and atmospheric effects
- üöÄ **Real NASA Asteroid Data** from the Near Earth Object API
- üìä **Advanced Trajectory Calculations** with collision probability assessment
- üí• **Impact Consequence Modeling** including blast radius, thermal radiation, and seismic effects
- üéÆ **Interactive 3D Controls** - zoom, pan, rotate around Earth
- üì± **Real-time UI** with asteroid details and threat assessment
- üîó **NASA Database Integration** with direct links to official asteroid data

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun

### NASA API Key Setup

1. Get a free NASA API key from [https://api.nasa.gov/](https://api.nasa.gov/)
2. Create a `.env.local` file in the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_NASA_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
3. Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual NASA API key

**Note:** The app will work with the demo key, but it has rate limits. A real API key provides higher rate limits and better reliability.

### Installation

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## How to Use

1. **Explore the 3D Earth**: Use mouse to rotate, scroll to zoom, right-click to pan
2. **View Asteroids**: Zoom out to see the asteroid field around Earth
3. **Select Scenarios**: Click on city markers or use the left sidebar
4. **Analyze Trajectories**: Click on trajectory lines to see detailed information
5. **View Details**: Click "View Full Details" to see comprehensive asteroid data
6. **Assess Threats**: Check collision probabilities and impact consequences

## Technical Details

- **Real Data**: Uses NASA's Near Earth Object API for current asteroid data
